<h3>What is PyGameAdd</h3>
PyGameAdd is a simple yet useful addon to the popular python library PyGame. It focuses on removing the "pygame." before many pygame functions. So far the is one for mouse, display, time, font, and image.
<br><br>
<h3>How to Use</h3>
To use PyGameAdd simply add the "PyGameAdd" folder to your python project. You could also just add the .py files directly, however this is not recomended as it maked your files more messy. After adding the folder to your project simply follow the instuctions on how to import below.
<br></br>
<h3>Importing</h3>
To import these simply just add "from PyGameAdd import" and then the respected library. For example to import the mouse library add "from PyGameAdd import mouse." If you just import "PyGameAdd" by itself then instead of pygame.mouse it would be PyGameAdd.mouse and the defeats the purpose of the addon.
